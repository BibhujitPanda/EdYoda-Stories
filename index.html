                            <p><span>EdYoda</span>&nbsp;| 11 jul 2019</p>
                            <p>If you learn cloud computing then you can make things much easier for your projects. You do not have to rely on multiple hard drives or data storage devices for with cloud computing you can store all your important data on a remote database. To put it simply cloud computing offers the delivery of different services through the internet. These services include tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. For a more efficient and smooth workflow, cloud computing surely seems to be taking over, and more and more people are moving to use it to the best of its services. Here all you need to know about it.</p>

                            <p><span>EdYoda</span>&nbsp;| 23 jul 2019</p>
                            <p>Big data is the phrase that is used to define large structured and unstructured volumes of data that has the potential to be mined for information and used in machine learning projects and other advanced analytics applications. According to the big data management, the quality of the data should be high and there should be accessibility for business intelligence. This information benefits corporations, government agencies, and other agencies to develop strategies to help them cope up with the fast-growing amount of data, typically involving the large size of data saved in many file formats. Therefore, it is recommended to learn big Data online courses from EdYoda -  A free technology learning and knowledge-sharing platform.</p>

                    <p><span>EdYoda</span>&nbsp;| 26 Aug 2019</p>
                    <p>As the dependency on online platforms is increasing daily, cybersecurity is becoming an important concern for all companies today. The number of cyberattacks is ever-rising even after adopting every security measure possible by businesses. Cyber attackers are developing advancing technologies that are continuing to cause more damage. There are many methods through which a cyber attack is committed like software vulnerabilities, user interaction (using malicious links, email attachments) and use of stolen credentials logins, encryption keys.</p>

                        <p>A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in order to bring about a positive change in the work environment. One of the main precautions or a contingency plan that is necessary for every business and especially industries working with clouds, networks and computers should conduct a backup of its files which will serve as a boon in any point of time.</p>

                        <p>We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, itâ€™s time to delve in a little deeper.</p>

                        <p><span>Zac Clancy</span>&nbsp; | 25 Sep 2019</p>
                        <p>Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to gather and analyze information from the Internet.Some websites and platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we can use to access information in a structured way, but others might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of interacting with todays popular platforms, we dont always have this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on the internet. Rather than reading data from standard API responses, we wll need to find the data ourselves by reading the websites pages and feeds.</p>
